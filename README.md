# TweetPaper

TweetPaper is a side project app that I built in about a day and a half using Ruby on Rails and some basic CSS to give a newspaper-y look to Twitter.

**Vimeo demo of  app: https://vimeo.com/140255173**

To run: Clone the repo, run 'bundle install' in terminal, and run 'rails server'. Navigate to localhost:3000 to get started.
